			<p>Cebu Technological University (CTU) Danao has a rich history, evolving from a provincial high school in 1949 to a leading technological university today.             
		       Initially established as "Danao Provincial High School," it transitioned into a national vocational secondary school in 1957.  The school underwent several name changes and site relocations, eventually settling in its current location in Sabang, Danao City in 1965.
			   In 1983, it became an extension campus of the Cebu State College of Science and Technology (CSCST) and gained independence as CSCST-College of Industrial Technology in 1984.  The focus shifted towards higher education in 1990, leading to the graduation of its first baccalaureate degree holders.
		   </p>
			
			<p>Through the efforts of Dr. Bonifacio Villanueva and legislative support, the school became part of Cebu Technological University in 2009.  CTU Danao now boasts 19 undergraduate and 9 graduate programs, serving over 4,156 students.  Many of these programs have achieved Level II and Level III accreditation from the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP).
 
				This history highlights CTU Danao's dedication to providing quality education and its commitment to continuous growth and development.
